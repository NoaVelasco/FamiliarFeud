# ImpFamiliar Feud, a simple card game

Personal project in order to learn and improve my OOP skills. And have fun.

ImpFamiliar Feud is a simple 2 players game with deck and dice construction. Choose your actions and upgrade your combat, ki or action skills. You have 3 familiars and they will fight for you: agressive, ki blocker and versatil.

## WIP
- Creating classes: Card, Deck, Hand, Dice, Turnâ€¦
- Thinking cards for the game
- Trying to figure out how to implement 2 players or 1 Vs dumb AI.
